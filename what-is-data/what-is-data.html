      <p><span class="newthought">There is evidence</span> that people fundamentally differ in their understanding of data. Three (implicit) philosophies speak of data as objective facts (measurements), as subjective observations (records), and as communications (signs). An example explains what this means in practice. The case study below is adapted from Brian Ballsun-Stanton’s PhD thesis Asking about data. He is an experimental philosopher and works as a data architect. I thank him for his permission to use it.</p>
      <p>I am a practitioner. Why, then, engage in philosophical questions? It sharpens your mind. You can use fun words like <em>geist</em> and <em>epistemological</em>. And, it can offer clarity in discussions about data and may help to resolve “silos”.</p>

      <h2>What is data?</h2>
        <p>Brian Ballsun-Stanton writes in his PhD thesis <em>Asking about data</em>: “I noticed that practitioners use and understand the term ‘data’ differently than the people they are helping.” <label for="sn-thesis" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-thesis" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Ballsun-Stanton, B. (2012). <em>Asking About Data: Exploring Different Realities of Data via the Social Data Flow Network Methodology.</em> Doctoral thesis, University of New South Wales.</span> He describes three philosophies of data. Before we explore them, here is a recent case study.</p>
        <blockquote>Imagine you are a tech team building a new online platform from scratch. Your umwelt (environment/surroundings) is data. You have great financial and intellectual freedom to build something that reflects the needs of users.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>A main feature of the desired architecture is often vocalised as “everything is data” and “we want to employ <em>all</em> the data”. But what do the parties involved mean by this? Would different concepts of data lead to different platforms?</blockquote>
